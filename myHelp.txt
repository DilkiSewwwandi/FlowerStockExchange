The stock market execution report status codes indicate the status of an order
that has been placed in the stock market. Here's what each status code means:

0 - New: This status code means that the order has been received by the stock market,
    but it has not been processed yet. It is waiting to be executed.

1 - Rejected: This status code means that the order has been rejected by the stock market.
    There could be various reasons for rejection, such as insufficient funds or an invalid order.

2 - Fill: This status code means that the order has been executed successfully,
    and the trade has been completed.

3 - Pfill: This status code means that a partial fill has been made for the order.
    This happens when the stock market is unable to execute the entire order at once, and it is filled in multiple transactions.

It's important to note that the interpretation of these status codes may vary
slightly between different stock markets and trading platforms.
